Website Code
======

This is the code for my personal website (vrk7bp.herokuapp.com). It is hosted on Heroku, and is built using Node.JS. This is my first experience with Node.JS, and I used the website as my personal project to learn about Web Development, PaaS, Git, and Node.JS as a whole. This project was done over my Spring 2014 Semester at the University of Virginia, as part of the CS 1501 class offered by the Engineering Student Council at U.Va.
